# AI Literacy Game - Development Progress

## Current Status (May 20, 2023)

### Core Game Engine
- âœ… `GameEngine` class implemented and connected to Redux
- âœ… `TileSystem` implemented with tile rendering
- âœ… `CharacterSystem` implemented with movement, teleportation, and rendering
- âœ… Player character rendering using player.png asset
- âœ… Floor, wall, and object rendering using custom assets
- âœ… NPC rendering and positioning

### Map System
- âœ… Test map created with layers (background, walls, objects)
- âœ… Map JSON structure defined with assets, properties
- âœ… NPCs added to map with interaction capabilities
- âœ… Collision detection and walkable tiles implemented

### UI Components
- âœ… Game container component with canvas
- âœ… HUD with player position display
- âœ… Module select page created
- âœ… Navigation between pages
- âœ… Basic dialog system implemented

### Asset Integration
- âœ… Asset loading system implemented
- âœ… Custom graphics for player, NPCs, floor, and walls
- âœ… Asset path structure established in public/assets/images/

### Redux State Management
- âœ… Game state slice for map and player data
- âœ… UI state slice for dialog and interface
- âœ… Activity slice for tracking progress

## Planned Learning Activities
- ðŸ”„ NPC 1: Multiple choice questions (3 questions)
- ðŸ”„ NPC 2: Drag & drop questions (2 questions with image+text cards)
- â¬œ NPC 3: Open-ended question with LLM grading (using GPT-4o)
- â¬œ NPC 4: Chatbot interaction (3 questions)

## Next Steps
- Implement dialog system for NPC interactions
- Create reusable activity components:
  - Multiple choice question component
  - Drag & drop component
  - Open-ended question component
  - Chatbot interface component
- Implement activity flow (dialog â†’ activity â†’ dialog)
- Create activity data structure for content management
- Add activity completion tracking

## Technical Notes
- Asset naming convention: Use the exact ID in the map JSON file (e.g., "npc-1.png")
- Assets should be placed in public/assets/images/ directory
- Game will automatically load player character image from player.png
