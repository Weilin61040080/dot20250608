# Asset Loading and Routing Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented for asset loading and routing issues in the AI Literacy Game.

## Asset Loading Improvements

### Problems Addressed

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: Assets were failing to load due to incorrect path construction in various components.
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Failed asset loads would cause rendering issues or silent failures.
3. **Inconsistent Path Handling**: Different components used different approaches to construct asset paths.
4. **No Fallback Mechanism**: When assets failed to load, there was no visual fallback.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Consistent Asset Path Construction

A unified approach to path construction was implemented:

```javascript
const getAssetBasePath = () => {
  // The public URL is either set in the env or uses the current basename
  const publicUrl = process.env.PUBLIC_URL || '';
  return `${publicUrl}/assets/`;
};
```

This function is now used in:
- `GameContainer.tsx` - For initializing the game engine
- `TileSystem.ts` - For loading tile and NPC images
- `CharacterSystem.ts` - For loading player character image
- `gameService.ts` - For loading map files

#### 2. Robust Error Handling

All asset loading now includes proper error handling:

```javascript
img.onerror = (error) => {
  console.warn(`Failed to load image: ${src}`, error);
  // Fallback rendering implementation
};
```

#### 3. Fallback Rendering

When assets fail to load, the game now provides visual fallbacks:

- **For Tiles**: Colored rectangles with the tile ID displayed
- **For NPCs**: Blue circles
- **For Player Character**: Orange circle with direction indicator
- **For Maps**: Fallback to static test map data

#### 4. Timeout Detection

To prevent indefinite loading states, timeout detection was added:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!this.tileImages.has(id)) {
    console.warn(`Image load timeout: ${src}`);
    // Create a synthetic error event
    const errorEvent = new Event('error');
    img.dispatchEvent(errorEvent);
  }
}, 5000);
```

#### 5. Enhanced Logging

Comprehensive logging was added throughout the asset loading process:

```javascript
console.log(`Loading tile image: ${imagePath}`);
console.log(`Image loaded successfully: ${src}`);
console.warn(`Failed to load image: ${src}`, error);
```

## Routing Improvements

### Problems Addressed

1. **Missing Routes**: Some menu items had no corresponding routes.
2. **Routing in Subdirectory**: Routing failed when deployed to a GitHub Pages subdirectory.
3. **No Fallback Route**: Incorrect URLs were not properly redirected.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Placeholder Pages

Simple placeholder pages were added for routes that aren't fully implemented yet:

```javascript
const PlaceholderPage: React.FC<{title: string}> = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ 
      display: 'flex', 
      flexDirection: 'column', 
      alignItems: 'center', 
      justifyContent: 'center',
      minHeight: '100vh',
      padding: '2rem',
      backgroundColor: 'var(--background-color)'
    }}>
      <h1 style={{ color: 'var(--primary-color)' }}>{title}</h1>
      <p>This page is under construction.</p>
      <a href="/" style={{
        marginTop: '2rem',
        padding: '1rem',
        backgroundColor: 'var(--primary-color)',
        color: 'white',
        textDecoration: 'none',
        borderRadius: '8px'
      }}>Back to Home</a>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. Dynamic Basename Detection

A `getBasename` function was added to correctly handle routing in different environments:

```javascript
const getBasename = () => {
  // For local development
  if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1') {
    // Parse the pathname to extract the base path if it exists
    const pathname = window.location.pathname;
    const basePath = pathname.split('/')[1]; // Get the first part of the path
    return basePath ? `/${basePath}` : '/';
  }
  
  // For production (GitHub Pages)
  return '/gamified_ai_literacy';
};
```

#### 3. Fallback Route

A catch-all route was added to redirect any unknown paths to the home page:

```javascript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
  <Route path="/game" element={<GamePage />} />
  <Route path="/modules" element={<PlaceholderPage title="Module Selection" />} />
  <Route path="/profile" element={<PlaceholderPage title="User Profile" />} />
  <Route path="/leaderboard" element={<PlaceholderPage title="Leaderboard" />} />
  {/* Fallback route for any unknown paths */}
  <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
</Routes>
```

## Benefits

These improvements have resulted in:

1. **Improved Robustness**: The game now works even when assets fail to load
2. **Better User Experience**: Users see placeholder content instead of errors
3. **Easier Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify asset loading issues
4. **Consistent Navigation**: All menu items now lead to valid routes
5. **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: The game works in both development and production environments
