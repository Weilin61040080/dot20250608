###Product Requirements Document (PRD)


##roduct Overview
The product is an educational game platform that enables learners to explore 2D tile-based worlds where they interact with objects and NPCs to trigger learning activities. The game is highly customizable, allowing for easy generation of themed assets using AI and the creation of diverse learning modules.
##Core Features

#Tile-Based World

2D grid-based movement system
AI-generated themed assets for tiles, objects, and characters
JSON-based map definition for easy editing and extension


#Module System

Each module contains unique maps, NPCs, scripts, and learning activities
Narrative progression through story plots triggered by learner activities
Learning activities tracked for analytics and progress


#Gamification Elements

Points system based on performance metrics
Leaderboards for competitive engagement
Mission/quest system with objectives
In-game store for rewards and customizations


#Learning Assessment

Track time spent on activities
Record correct/incorrect responses
Capture feedback provided to learners
Map activities to learning objectives


#Asset Generation System

AI-powered generation of themed assets
Consistent style generation across different themes
Designer input for theme specification



#User Flow

User selects or continues a module
User navigates character through the tile map
User interacts with objects/NPCs to trigger learning activities
User completes activities to earn points and progress the story
User views progress, leaderboards, and manages earned rewards

#MVP Scope
For the MVP version:

Support for manual creation of tile maps via JSON
Basic character movement and interaction system
Simple learning activity framework with 2-3 activity types
Core gamification elements (points, simple missions)
Basic analytics tracking
Support for one complete learning module

## Active Development Context

### Current Focus
- Setting up initial project structure
- Creating the foundation for the game engine
- Implementing the tile map rendering system

### Architecture Decisions
- Using React with TypeScript for frontend development
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Custom game engine layer to handle game logic
- Tile-based movement system using HTML5 Canvas for rendering

### Implementation Priorities
1. Core game engine components (TileSystem, CharacterController, InteractionSystem)
2. Basic map rendering and navigation
3. Object and NPC interaction
4. Simple learning activities

### Notes
- Starting with frontend components; backend implementation will follow
- Using static JSON files for initial map and game data
- Will implement user authentication and server-side components after core game functionality
